This calculator is inspired by Christopher Kirk-Nielsen's post, "[Modern Fluid Typography with Clamp()](https://chriskirknielsen.com/blog/modern-fluid-typography-with-clamp/)"

For another fallback strategy that matches clamp's functionality, see Daniel Yuschick's "[Fluid Typography with CSS Clamp() is My New Favorite Thing](https://dev.to/yuschick/fluid-typography-with-css-clamp-is-my-new-favorite-thing-4lg3)"
